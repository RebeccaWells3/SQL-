# SQL
This my final project I did for _D326:Advanced Data Management_. I designed a small reporting pipeline that included raw data extraction, custom transformations, summary table creation, and automated refresh logic using triggers and stored procedures to answer business questions. I was instructed to turn in my code using a word document and record a video presentation showing that my code worked.
